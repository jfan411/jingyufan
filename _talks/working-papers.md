### [Corruption Networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UNshAVVsJ8pYY97G_kUB501z-oHfVqZh/view?usp=sharing)   _[ job market paper/submitted ]_
**Abstract:** This paper studies how an agent's propensity to accept bribes depends on the organizational structure, which we model with a broad set of random networks that contains two canonical special cases. In _hierarchies_, agents' best responses exhibit _strategic substitutability_, with bribe taking being risker if others accept more bribes, for it is then easier for a corruption investigation to trace through bribe transactions to locate bribe takers. On the contrary, best responses in flat, _two-layer networks_ feature _strategic complementarity_, as more bribe acceptances better protect criminal subordinates from being caught, reducing the risk of bribe taking. While incentives differ across networks, we show that for any of our random network, in equilibrium, increasing its density always deters agents from accepting bribes. Nevertheless, opposite results for hierarchies and two-layer networks are obtained if we make the number of subordinates each agent monitors more evenly distributed. We use this model to point out a corruption identification problem and propose a remedy to it.

### Cooperative Games with Other-Regarding Preferences   _[ draft coming soon ]_
**Abstract:** This paper studies how parochial other-regarding incentives – a player's exclusive concerns about the welfares of the others in the same social group – affect group allocation stability. We propose a new theoretical framework based on transferable-utility (TU) cooperative games through extending the utility space to incorporate in players' other-regarding incentives. We then apply the Fehr-Schmidt (FS) utility specification to study how core allocations are shaped by parochial fairness concerns. We derive an efficient technique to solve for the core: given an income profile, we characterize the associated _shadow allocation_ for each coalition that makes the coalition members indifferent between deviating and not. Our main result shows that unlike the TU game with purely self-interested agents where a coalition always finds it the hardest to block the equal allocation, in the FS game, if players are _benevolent_, i.e., they dislike income comparison with the poorer, we may obtain the surprising "tyranny-of-the-majority" outcome where the hardest-to-block income profile is the one that gives the poorest player indefinitely small amount and equates the other players' incomes.
